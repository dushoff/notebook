The Are distribution and the link to tsetse loops

Let $$p+q=1$$ for convenience

* $$ P = a q p^k$$
* $$ φ = 1-a + \frac{aq}{1-px}$$
* $$ R = φ'(1) = ap/q$$
* $$ E = φ(E)$$ seems solved by $$E = 1$$ _or_ $$\frac{1-ap}{p}$$

If $$a=1$$, this behaves as expected: $$R=p/q$$, $$E=1/R$$ (when $$R≥1$$).

When $$a<1$$ we need to adjust. The probability of extinction from the count point is related to the probability of extinction from the loop point: $$E_c = 1- p_o + p_oE_\ell$$
