title: Disease aging and adaptation
---

Had a nice time recently at the [JSMF](https://www.jsmf.org/)-[SFI](https://www.santafe.edu/) __Workshop on complex systems science â€“ the Arrow of Time, Adaptation and Aging.__ 

Gave an informal talk; as usual with informal talks, it's hard to say whether the [slides](https://github.com/dushoff/Disease_evolution/blob/sfi_slides/git_push/talk.draft.pdf) are of much use.
