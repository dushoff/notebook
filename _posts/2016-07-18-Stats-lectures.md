The new home for my ICI3D-style stats lectures is [this stats talks repo](https://github.com/dushoff/statistics_talks/).

I'm trying to:

* reduce my dependence on WW/Dropbox stuff
* unify lectures (using the "newtalk" framework in makestuff)
* consolidate (to some extent at least)

I should also try to:

* document better where things are (I guess)

Right now I find things by going through functional directories (like the stats talks repo) and seeing where they point.

Here are the versions of the stats lectures that I gave at the [2016 Summer Course on Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of 
Infectious Diseases](http://www.ncts.ntu.edu.tw/templet3/index.php?nid=73&bid=2) at [National Taiwan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Taiwan_University)

* [Statistical philosophy](https://github.com/dushoff/statistics_talks/blob/NTU16/philosophy.draft.pdf)
* [Fitting dynamical models to data](https://github.com/dushoff/statistics_talks/blob/NTU16.w/fitting.draft.pdf)

The first is closely based on [ICI3D](http://www.ici3d.org/) lectures I've given for years at MMED and DAIDD; the second is more foundational and was meant to cover topics requested by Hirioshi Nishiura.
