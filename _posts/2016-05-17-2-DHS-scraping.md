Working on the [DHS overview project](https://github.com/dushoff/DHS_overview). Doing a reasonably good job of scraping information about available DHS data sets. Not sure whether to promote this, because I'm not sure whether there is a real database from DHS that we could use instead of the ugly scraping. There are also a few warnings from the pipeline which should be checked.

In the meantime, have generated [this table with tags and file names.](/notebook/materials/standard.files.html)
