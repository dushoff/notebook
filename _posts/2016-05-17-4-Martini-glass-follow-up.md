In fact, the two-dimensional answer ($$q=p^2$$) is right in three dimensions as well! This must mean that the third dimension scales as $$q^{1/2}$$. It's [explained nicely by Laurent Lessard](http://www.laurentlessard.com/bookproofs/overflowing-martini-glass/).

I verified with a [cute-ish R script](/notebook/martini.R).
