I have started unifying my presentation formats and moving things to
github. [Here is a mostly githubbed (and reasonably archived) version of UWO 2015](https://github.com/dushoff/Ebola_talks/blob/UW0_2015/math.draft.pdf).

Also imported some other, very limited, directories to github, because they were used here:

* [Ebola sims](https://github.com/dushoff/Ebola_sims) does some very simple sims (from the asymptomatic paper)

* [Generation distributions](https://github.com/dushoff/Generation_distributions) pictures and tests of the filtered mean and moment stuff.
