title: Origins colloquium
---

Talked at the McMaster [Origins Institute](https://origins.mcmaster.ca/) [colloquium](https://origins.mcmaster.ca/events/colloquia). Didn't quite get to all the details, but thought I handled it OK. 

The [slides](https://github.com/dushoff/Generation_talks/blob/73dc9f7df1bcb8c7fe6bf231326abc62899e7bdd/git_push/origins.draft.pdf) are on a new [Generation_talks repo](https://github.com/dushoff/Generation_talks).
