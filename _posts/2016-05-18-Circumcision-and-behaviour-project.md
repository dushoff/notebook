* Moving MC analysis code from [the circumcision wiki](http://lalashan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/circumcision/index.php/MC_risk_Africa) to [a corresponding repo](https://github.com/dushoff/Circumcision_and_behaviour). It's really nice that this makes it easy to make the code public without making the data public. Also, _once you get the code to make on your machine_ it's easier to play with this way.

* Going to give up on the [DHS Downloading repo](https://github.com/mac-theobio/DHS_downloads). There seem to be real tools out there now.
