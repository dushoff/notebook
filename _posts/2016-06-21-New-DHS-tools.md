I am going to replace all of my DHS tools with more principled ones. I am going to query the database using the DHS API, and I am going to download stuff using an R script based on [anthony joseph damico's DHS scraping script](https://github.com/ajdamico/asdfree/blob/master/Demographic%20and%20Health%20Surveys/download%20and%20import.R) (but not scraping the whole database as his apparently does).

I guess this means still more DHS repos? Or maybe I'll just completely replace contents from some of the existing ones.

The damico code does not actually seem to be running, though! Man.
