Number of algebraically inequivalent expressions with n operands and n-1 binary operators +-*/^.

Closely related to https://oeis.org/A140606, which does not allow ^.

The first three terms are 1, 8, 146. It does not currently appear in OEIS.

The fourth term is 4294.

The associativity/commutativity combinations are 4444. We do these by counting recursively across ways of partitioning the top

There are 150 extra repetitions:

18 pairs of the form (a-b)∘(c-d); ∘ refers to multiplicative combination – x∘y expands to x*y,x/y,y/x

72 excess terms of the form a-(b∘(c-d)); these can be expressed using "a+".

12 pairs of the form (a/b)^(c-d)

24 excess terms of the form a/(b^(c-d)); can be expressed using "a*".

24 excess terms of the form a/((b/c)^d)
