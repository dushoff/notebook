[A Light Introduction to Modelling Recurrent Epidemics (David Earn)](https://ms.mcmaster.ca/earn/pdfs/Earn2008_LightIntro.pdf) is a good read if you're not familiar with SIR modeling. There's also a [video by JD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVu62qVUj3I), which is possibly fun, but definitely long.

[Gostic et al.](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409) reviewed ways of thinking about and estimating reproductive numbers in the context of COVID.

[Cori et al.](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/178/9/1505/89262) is a pioneering paper about estimating _instantaneous_ reproductive numbers; and 
[Wallinga and Teunis](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/178/9/1505/89262) is a pioneering paper about _case_ reproductive numbers.

[Granich et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19038438/) is a high-profile application of what JD likes to call “phenomenological heterogeneity”, also used by [macpan2](https://canmod.github.io/macpan2/) models during COVID.

[Miller et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.6320) is a really cool abstraction for thinking about epidemics on networks.

[Our work on variance conservation](https://github.com/mikeroswell/epiExplore/blob/main/outputs/proof.pdf) builds on a lot of this.
