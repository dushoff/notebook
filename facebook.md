If x and y are the two ages, then $$xy = (x-y)^2 - 1$$.

We can rewrite this as $$x^2 - 3xy + y^2 = 1$$, which we can abbreviate as $$f(x, y) = 1$$.

Factor $$x^2 - 3xy + y^2 = (x-σy)(x-τy)$$. We are going to find solutions based on the properties of σ, without ever worrying about the value of σ. I have the idea this sort of trick used to be called manipulating surds.
