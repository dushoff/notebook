I identify as male, and you are welcome to refer to me using he/him.
You are also welcome – encouraged, even – to refer to me using
they/them, particularly if you don’t know me well.

I am hoping to someday live in a world where we don’t always need to
know somebody’s gender to refer to them, especially in business or
professional contexts.
