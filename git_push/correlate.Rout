## Start with a basis vector
## Add a second vector with 0.96 weight corresponding to the basis vector
## And a third with 0.6 weight corresponding to the basis vector
## These numbers were chosen in honor of Pythagoras â˜º

## Doing this with all positive entries gives the maximum correlation
> mx <- matrix(
+ 	c(
+ 	  1.00, 0.00, 0.00
+ 	, 0.96, 0.28, 0.00
+ 	, 0.60, 0.80, 0.00
+ 	), nrow=3
+ )
> print(t(mx) %*% mx)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 1.00 0.96  0.6
[2,] 0.96 1.00  0.8
[3,] 0.60 0.80  1.0

## Reversing one of the signs gives the minimum
> mx <- matrix(
+ 	c(
+ 	  1.00, 0.00, 0.00
+ 	, 0.96, 0.28, 0.00

[2,] 0.96 1.000 0.352
[3,] 0.60 0.352 1.000

## The answers are the values next to the lower corner (0.8 and 0.352)
## How did you do?
