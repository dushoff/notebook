title: 1/17

1/17 is less exciting than [1/19](19.md), but provides good examples of two other nice cases of tricks for expansions.

## Dividing by 8

First, let's get the answer. Just as we write:

1/19 = 21/399 - 21/(4H-1), we can write (using H for 100 and h for 0.01):

1/17 = 47/799 = 47/(8H-1) = 47h/(8-h), and expand that as 


1/17 = 47/8 h + 47/8² h² + …

```
1/17 = 
.         47/8 = 5r7
05        705/8 = 88r1 (the 7 is the remainder from the line above)
88        188/8 = 23r4 (the 1 is the remainder from the line above)
23        423/8 = 52r7 (the 2 is the remainder from the line above)
52        752/8 = 94r0
94        94/8 = 11r6
11        611/8 = 76r3
76        376/8 = 47r0
47
…
```

## Multiplying by a negative number

We could also write 1/17 as 53/901. This has no obvious advantages over using 799, but it's sort of pedagogic here. Plus, it's always fun to do the same calculation in different ways.

In this case, we _subtract_ the current digits from the remainder (after "advancing" by multiplying by 100). So remainders of 0 are not allowed (and thus remainders of 9 when dividing by 9 are! so that's fun).

```
1/17 = 
.         53/9 = 5r8
05        795/9 = 88r3 (We subtract 05 from 800)
88        212/9 = 23r5 (We subtract 88 from 300)
23        477/9 = 52r9 (the 2 is the remainder from the line above)
52        848/9 = 94r2
94        106/9 = 11r7
11        689/9 = 76r5
76        424/9 = 47r1
47
…
```
