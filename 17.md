1/17 is less exciting than [1/19](19.md), but provides good examples of two other nice cases of tricks for expansions.

## Dividing by 8

First, let's get the answer. Just as we write:

1/19 = 21/399 - 21/(4H-1), we can write (using H for 100 and h for 0.01):

1/17 = 47/799 = 47/(8H-1) = 47h/(8-h), and expand that as 


1/17 = 47/8 h + 47/8² h² + …

```
1/17 = 
.         47/8 = 5r7
05        705/8 = 88r1
88        188/8 = 23r4 (the 1 is the remainder from the line above)
23        423/8 = 52r7 (the 4 is the remainder from the line above)
52        752/8 = 94r0 …
94        94/8 = 11r6
11        611/8 = 76r3
76        376/8 = 47r0
47        47/8 = 5r7
05
…
```

Notice that the first value in the calculation (705, 188, etc.) is always divisible by the numerator (47)

## Multiplying by -2

If we use 5×17 = 85 ~ 100, we have to multiply by 15 which seems awkward. 102 seems like a better starting point, but we need to figure out tricks for the minus sign. 

1/17 = 6/102 = 6/(H+2) = 6h/(1+2h) = 6h - 6 = 6 - 6×2h + 6×2² h² - …

We can do that with pre-emptive borrowing:

```
1/17 = 
.         6 - 1 (which we foresee we need to borrow
05        100 (the borrowed 1) - 2*05 - 2 (borrowing)
88        200 (borrowed) - 2*88 - 1 …
23        100 - 2×23 - 2
52        200 - 2×52 - 2
94        200 - 2×94 - 1
11        100 - 2×11 - 2
76        200 - 2×76 - 1
47        100 - 2×47 - 1
05 
…
```

Note that the partial sum before borrowing (100-2×23, 200-2×52) is always divisible by the numerator (6)


What about another way?

If we use 5×17 = 85 ~ 100, we have to multiply by 15 which seems awkward. So we 6×17=102. 

1/89 = 1/(T² - T - 1) (where T=ten), has an expansion that follows the rules of [the Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) (each number is based on the sum of the two before it). So that's cool, but 1/89 is kind of a long expansion, and expanding things in groups of 1 (instead of 2) decimals feels a bit ticky. By the way, there's also a one-digit way to do 1/19: since 19=2T-1, you can expand it by dividing each digit by two (exactly parallel to dividing pairs of digits by 4).  

So the other day, in the shower, I was wondering about 9899 = H² - H -1, and whether it has any nice factors. Imagine my surprise when I found out that 1/19 = 521/9899! That means that we can write the expansion 1/19 using Fibonacci rules.

```
1/19 = 
.         start with the 5 from 521
05        (+ 21 = 26) (the 21 is from 521)
26        (+ 5 = 31)
31        (+ 26 = 57)
57        (+ 31 + 1 = 89) (the one is pre-emptively carried from the next sum)
89        (+ 57 + 1 = 147) …
47        (+ 89 = 136)
36        (+ 47 + 1 = 84)
84        (+ 36 + 1 = 121)
21        (+ 84 = 105)
05
…
```

Yet another fun way to generate the same decimal! I can die happy now.
