Tug McGraw:

> If I come in to pitch with the bases loaded, and a heavy hitter at the plate, there’s no good reason for me to want to throw the ball. As long as I keep it in my glove, nothing bad can happen. 

> But eventually I have to pitch. So I remind myself that in a few billion years the earth will become a frozen snowball hurtling through space, and nobody’s going to care what Willie Stargell did with the bases loaded.
