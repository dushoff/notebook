title: Climate disingenuity

My comments on [this Scott Adams post](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/155073242136/the-climate-science-challenge) (shouldn't really have taken the time).

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Paraphrasing a bit ☺

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Do the engineers really agree that the Titanic is sinking? I don't know.

Let's find out. Find an engineer and ask them whether they believe we can predict the Titanic's future in detail. When will it sink? Will it shift? Tilt?

Your engineer will fight like a cornered animal to conflate the evidence that the Titanic is going to sink with the credibility of these detailed predictions. Don’t let that happen. Make your engineer tell you whether detailed predictions about the sinking are credible. Or not.

Because that was the question. Except that it wasn't.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

That's the content of this post. 

The scientific consensus is _solid_ that there's a serious problem, and _weak_ on details. The poster is intentionally trying to conflate these.

Excellent persuasion, and utterly disingenuous. Like so much of this site.
