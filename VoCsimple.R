## To estimate R we need an estimate of fbar and kappa â€“ the mean and shape of the forward serial interval (since we're observing incidence of reports)

fbar <- 4.7*day
kappa <- 0.5 ## SEIR-like (see lots and lots of stuff that I never ever write up)

R_wt <- genExp(r_wt*fbar, kappa)
R_voc <- genExp(r_voc*fbar, kappa)
ratio <-
