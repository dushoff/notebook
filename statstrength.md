To use statistics to infer whether an effect is large, we need a _prior_ specification of what is meant by large. There are then 6 possible ways the CIs can play out for a single estimand (after collapsing symmetries). What are good ways to describe them?

Here are some suggestions. I am interested in comments and other suggestions. I am tempted to say we could consider reclaiming "significant" for effect size, as in "clinically significant" or "biologically significant". 

## A

The effect is clearly large and positive.

## B

The effect is clearly positive; it is not clear whether it is large (3/7)

## C

The effect is clearly small and positive. (3/7)

## D

The effect is clearly small; it is not clear whether it is positive (4/7)

## E

The effect is uncertain but it is not both large and negative. (5/7)

## F

Next time, we will do a power analysis before conducting a study â˜º (6/7)

None of this is a replacement for showing the #ConfidenceIntervals. But I believe it's also important how we talk about stuff. A lot of science gets lost in whispering down the lane.
