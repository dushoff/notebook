title: Multiple imputation
---

I've been thinking about multiple imputation. There are some fields where people routinely use multiple imputation when there is missing data, and I think this is based on a mis-apprehension.

The argument goes roughly like this:

* missing completely at random doesn't sound likely
* missing not at random isn't fixable
* therefore, my case is presumably the other thing

The problem is that "isn't fixable" ‚áè "unlikely".

Multiple imputation attempts to guess missing values based on other information about the same record. When would that be good, bad or ugly?
